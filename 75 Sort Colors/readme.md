Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.
 

## Examples

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]
```

Constraints:

`n == nums.length`

`1 <= n <= 300`

`nums[i]` is either `0`, `1`, or `2`

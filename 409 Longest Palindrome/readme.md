Given a string s which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the longest 
palindrome
 that can be built with those letters.

Letters are case sensitive, for example, _**"Aa"**_ is not considered a palindrome.


## Examples

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abccccdd"
Output: 7
Explanation: One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: s = "a"
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest palindrome that can be built is "a", whose length is 1.
```


Constraints:

`1 <= s.length <= 2000`

`S` consists of lowercase and/or uppercase English letters only.
